            <p>
              Tera Ann Harris was a devoted mother of seven daughters, all of whom she proudly supported through college education. Her life was marked by her unconditional love for her family and her unwavering spirit in the face of adversity.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Her legacy lives on through her daughters, who remember her for her strength, compassion, and the values she instilled in them. Despite the challenges she faced, Tera maintained her dignity and grace. It's important to note that throughout her entire life, <span className="text-purple-50 font-semibold">Tera never had a single drug charge or drug-related offense</span> on her record, making the official account of her death by fentanyl overdose particularly suspicious and contradictory to her documented history.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The TERA token was created to honor her memory and to ensure that her story continues to inspire others. Through this initiative, we aim to support social justice causes that promote accountability in the legal system and challenge false narratives about individuals in custody.

                After an accident involving her husband, Tera was placed in jail despite her serious medical condition. She could barely stand or speak properly during this time, and anyone viewing video footage from this period can clearly see something was severely wrong with her health. Despite this obvious medical distress, she was incarcerated for 8 months before being released.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mt-4 text-lg">
                In a particularly troubling incident a few years prior, officers spotted Tera at a bus stop and arrested her without apparent provocation. They took her to a holding cell and, while she was detained, proceeded to enter and search her home without proper authorization. During this questionable search, they claimed to have found a gun in her house, which was then used as retroactive justification for her arrest.

              <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mt-4 text-lg">
                This disturbing sequence of events - arbitrary arrest followed by warrantless search - represents a clear violation of constitutional rights and suggests a pattern of targeted enforcement aimed at disrupting her life and possibly discouraging her ongoing advocacy work.

                These repeated interactions with the justice system highlight a concerning pattern in which Tera, known for her advocacy and willingness to challenge authorities, became increasingly vulnerable to institutional mistreatment.

                      According to a report released by Multnomah County officials, Tera Harris allegedly died from a fentanyl overdose. The report states she had a history of drug use and was on an "opioid use therapy plan prior to incarceration." Officials claim they found her "on the floor of her cell" and attempted to administer Narcan four times, but she could not be revived.

                      It would have been physically impossible for Tera to obtain fentanyl. She was in solitary confinement ("the hole") with absolutely no contact with other inmates, having only a blanket and mat, with officers present 24/7 as her only human contact besides brief medical staff interactions.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-purple-100 text-sm mt-2">
                      Despite the county's claim of a fentanyl overdose, Tera's drug screens had consistently come back clean for years. She had been placed in solitary after being attacked by officers following a phone call to her daughters, making any access to contraband substances physically impossible.

                      Witness testimony confirms Tera had been requesting proper medical care for days, with her requests denied. She returned from her final nurse visit disoriented and limping, escorted by five officers. An officer remained in her cell for an extended period afterward, positioned away from surveillance cameras.

                      The timing of her death‚Äîshortly after filing legal action against corrections officials‚Äîcombined with her complete isolation from anyone except officers and medical staff, points to a troubling alternative explanation for her sudden death.

                      <h4 className="text-purple-100 font-semibold">Final Incarceration - Officer Deception & Intimidation</h4>
                      <p className="text-purple-200 mt-1">
                        During her final days, high-ranking sheriff's officers were falsely presenting themselves to Tera as "counselors" while providing no actual counseling services. Documentation shows that at least two deputy sheriffs repeatedly identified themselves as "mental health counselors" on visitation logs and in communications, despite having no counseling credentials or training.
                      </p>
                      <p className="text-purple-200 mt-1">
                        These same officers were communicating with Tera through "kites" (prison notes/request slips). While pretending to be supportive counselors, these kites contained veiled threats related to her pending legal action against the facility. Tera reported these threatening messages to her family during phone calls, describing how certain officers would slip notes under her cell door with warnings to drop her lawsuit.
                      </p>
                      <p className="text-purple-200 mt-1">
                        In response, Tera filed multiple formal "keep separate" requests against these specific officers, explicitly noting their misrepresentation of their roles. Phone call records show she repeatedly expressed fear to her children, naming the officers specifically and describing these deceptive interactions through kites and verbal intimidation.
                      </p>
                      <p className="text-purple-200 mt-1">
                        Despite these documented "keep separate" requests, facility records show these same officers continued to be assigned to her unit and had direct contact with her in the days leading up to her death. The family has meticulously compiled a complete list of all officers and nursing staff who interacted with Tera in her final days, identifying which were falsely presenting themselves as counselors.
                      </p>
                      <p className="text-purple-200 mt-1">
                        <span className="font-semibold text-red-300">Critical evidence has been systematically withheld:</span> The facility has refused to release copies of these kites, the complete duty roster showing which officers were present during Tera's final days, surveillance footage from the hallway outside her cell, and complete medical records. Multiple FOIA requests have been denied citing "ongoing investigation" despite years passing since her death.
                      </p>
                      <p className="text-purple-200 mt-1">
                        <span className="font-semibold text-red-300">Deliberate concealment of identities:</span> Following Tera's death, an investigation revealed that the officers who had been communicating with her through kites and falsely presenting themselves as counselors were nowhere to be found in the jail's personnel database. Those who could be identified had been rapidly transferred to other facilities or departments within days of her death. Prison staff identification numbers provided to the family did not match any records in the system, suggesting deliberate manipulation of personnel records.
                      </p>
                      <p className="text-purple-200 mt-1">
                        This systematic erasure of the officers' presence at the facility suggests a coordinated effort to shield them from accountability. Despite these obstacles, the family has managed to compile names and identification numbers from Tera's phone calls, letters, and visit logs, which provide crucial evidence of who had contact with her in the days before her death.

                        Tera called her daughters the day before her death, expressing fear for her safety and specifically naming officers who had threatened her. Within 24 hours of this call, she was found unresponsive in her cell after being seen escorted by five officers from a medical visit in a disoriented state.
