# TERA Mining Control Panel - Mission & Integration Guide

## üéØ PRIMARY MISSION
This is a **CONTROL PANEL** application for managing the core features of an existing cryptocurrency mining platform. This is NOT meant to replace the user's main platform, but to provide administrative control over Guardian AI systems, mining operations, and backend features.

## üèóÔ∏è APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE
- **Type**: Full-stack web application
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with real-time WebSocket connections
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Key Features**: Real-time mining stats, AI Guardian management, pool control

## üîÑ INTEGRATION PURPOSE
The user has an EXISTING platform with its own:
- User interface and branding (DO NOT CHANGE)
- User authentication system
- User onboarding flow
- Visual design and layout

This control panel should integrate WITH their platform, not replace it. Integration options:
1. **Iframe embedding** (easiest)
2. **API integration** (most flexible)
3. **Component extraction** (requires matching tech stack)

## üõ°Ô∏è CORE FEATURES TO MAINTAIN

### Guardian AI Management
- TERA Guardian entities with different specializations
- Ghost Chat system for AI communication
- AI optimization and performance monitoring
- Training modules and progression tracking

### Mining Operations Control
- Real-time hashrate and performance monitoring
- Multi-pool management (F2Pool, Antpool, SlushPool, etc.)
- KloudBugs Pool (TERA Pool Project) management
- Ghost Feather virtual mining system
- Hardware monitoring and optimization

### Security & API Management
- API key management for external services
- Secure automatic payout configuration
- Pool connection management
- Performance analytics

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### What NOT to Include:
- ‚ùå Private key handling or wallet generation
- ‚ùå Manual Bitcoin transactions
- ‚ùå Any unsafe cryptographic operations
- ‚ùå Changes to the user's main platform appearance

### What TO Focus On:
- ‚úÖ Automatic payouts to user's address
- ‚úÖ Secure API integrations
- ‚úÖ Real-time mining data
- ‚úÖ Guardian AI management
- ‚úÖ Professional admin interface

## üîß CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### Completed Features:
- ‚úÖ Unified web-optimized dashboard with 9 tabs
- ‚úÖ Mobile-responsive navigation with hamburger menu
- ‚úÖ Overview with real-time stats display
- ‚úÖ Mining control center with Ghost Feather system
- ‚úÖ TERA Guardian AI management and training
- ‚úÖ Ghost Chat with AI entity communication
- ‚úÖ API key management for mining pools
- ‚úÖ Hardware monitoring and analytics
- ‚úÖ KloudBugs Pool integration
- ‚úÖ Wallet management (automatic payouts only)

### Architecture Notes:
- Uses React Query for data fetching with 2-second intervals
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Modular component structure for easy integration
- Professional dark theme with glassmorphism effects

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS FOR INTEGRATION

### For the Next Developer:
1. **Assess the user's existing platform technology stack**
2. **Determine best integration method** (iframe, API, or components)
3. **Set up authentication bridge** between platforms
4. **Configure automatic payout system** to user's wallet address
5. **Test all Guardian AI features** work properly
6. **Ensure real-time data flows** correctly

### Integration Questions to Ask User:
- What technology is your main platform built with?
- How do you want users to access this control panel?
- Do you need single sign-on between platforms?
- What wallet address should receive automatic payouts?
- Are there specific mining pools you want prioritized?
