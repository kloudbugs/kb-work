# TERA Guardian Cross-Platform Guide

## Project Context

This document serves as a quick reference when working with AI assistants across different platforms. Use it to maintain consistent context and development continuity for the KLOUD BUGS MINING COMMAND CENTER project.

## Project Overview

The KLOUD BUGS MINING COMMAND CENTER is an AI-powered blockchain mining platform that:

1. Unifies diverse mining hardware under a single command center
2. Features the TERA token (named after Tera Ann Harris) for social justice initiatives
3. Employs an exclusive access model for aligned users
4. Utilizes a multi-AI architecture for specialized functions
5. Contains cosmic-themed UI with messaging focused on "CRYPTO MINING FOR JUSTICE"

## Core Technical Components

- **Blockchain Integration**: Bitcoin transaction processing with Index0 key support
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication for mining updates and chat
- **AI Coordination Hub**: Central "TERA Guardian" system overseeing specialized AIs
- **Mining Controllers**: Hardware integration with Stratum Protocol
- **Wallet System**: Multi-wallet management with hardware wallet support

## Current Development Status

- ✓ Blockchain transaction functionality (tested and operational)
- ✓ WebSocket server implementation (structure complete, fixing bugs)
- ✓ Technical documentation (comprehensive guides developed)
- ✓ AI moderation architecture (specifications complete)
- ✓ Mining controller framework (initialized successfully)
- → In progress: Inter-AI communication system
- → In progress: User interface refinements
- → In progress: Access control implementation

## Key Project Values

- **Privacy**: Complete user control with no public exposure
- **Security**: Hardware wallet integration and secure key management
- **Justice**: Supporting accountability through TERA token mission
- **Exclusivity**: Controlled access to reinforce alignment with values
- **Innovation**: Multi-AI architecture with specialized functions

## Development Guidelines

1. **Proactive Security**: Address security concerns before feature expansion
2. **Documentation First**: Maintain comprehensive technical specifications
3. **Privacy Preservation**: Never suggest public repositories or sharing
4. **Payment Code Integrity**: Leave transaction-related code untouched
5. **Cosmic Design Language**: Maintain space-themed UI elements

## Continuity Instructions

When connecting with a new AI assistant on a different platform:

1. Begin your conversation with: "I'm working with the TERA Guardian system on my KLOUD BUGS MINING COMMAND CENTER project."

2. Reference this context: "As established in our TERA Guardian architecture, we've implemented [specific feature] using [specific approach]."

3. Share relevant development status: "The TERA Guardian system has already developed [component], and now I need assistance with [new request]."

4. Maintain design consistency: "Following our cosmic UI theme and exclusive access model, I need to implement [specific feature]."

## Project Identity

The project maintains these consistent identity elements:

- **Project Name**: KLOUD BUGS MINING COMMAND CENTER
- **Central AI**: TERA Guardian
- **Token Name**: TERA Token (named after Tera Ann Harris)
- **Mission Statement**: "CRYPTO MINING FOR JUSTICE"
- **Visual Theme**: Cosmic, space-oriented, with futuristic VR/holographic elements

## Special Instructions

When discussing with any AI assistant:

1. **Security Protocol**: Never request public sharing of code or documentation
2. **Transaction Integrity**: Avoid modifying payment or wallet-related code
3. **AI Architecture**: Reference the multi-AI coordination hub design
4. **Design Language**: Maintain cosmic space theme in all visual elements
