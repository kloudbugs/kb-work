# KloudBugZigMiner Technical Architecture

## Mining Integration System

### Unified Mining Approach
- **Worker Standardization**: All mining devices use identical worker name "KLOUD-BUGS-MINING-CAFE"
- **Pool Connection**: Currently focused on Unmineable for initial implementation
- **Hardware Support**: Compatible with all major mining equipment manufacturers:
  - Antminer S9, S19 Pro, S21 XP (14-140 TH/s)
  - Whatsminer M30S++ (112 TH/s)
  - Avalon A1246 (90 TH/s)
  - MicroBT M50 (126 TH/s)
  - Innosilicon T3+ (67 TH/s)
  - Canaan A12 (94 TH/s)
  - And any other standard mining equipment

### Network Infrastructure
- **Core Devices**: Initial network built with 2 Macs, Acer Aspire, and 10ZIG
- **Expandable Architecture**: Designed to accommodate unlimited devices
- **Computing Aggregation**: All hashpower calculated collectively as one entity
- **Performance Optimization**: Hashrate multipliers and mining boost capabilities

## Platform Components

### Ghost Mining Simulator
- **Testing Environment**: Simulates mining activity without actual hardware
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjustable miner count, model types, and regions
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks simulated hashrates and expected earnings
- **Admin Controls**: Password-protected administrator interface

### Network Dashboard
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks overall network performance
- **Individual Device Status**: Monitors each connected miner's contribution
- **Reward Tracking**: Calculates earnings and distribution
- **Network Growth Metrics**: Visualizes the expansion of the mining network

### User Management
- **Onboarding Process**: Simple setup for new miners joining the network
- **Authentication System**: Secure access to individual accounts
- **Permission Levels**: Differentiated admin and standard user capabilities
- **Profile Management**: User account customization and settings

## Token System

### TERA Token Foundation
- **Initial Implementation**: Starting with a focused single token
- **Reward Distribution**: Algorithm for fair allocation of mining rewards
- **Transparency Mechanisms**: Clear tracking of token generation and usage
- **Social Impact Allocation**: Portion of rewards dedicated to justice initiatives

### Future Expansion
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to support additional tokens and features
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Potential integration with other blockchain networks
- **Smart Contract Infrastructure**: Framework for advanced token functionality
- **Governance System**: Community input on platform decisions and priorities
