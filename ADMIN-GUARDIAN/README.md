## Sensitive Components

This version contains sensitive components that should never be shared:

2. Transaction signing capabilities
3. Blockchain node connection details
4. Security key rotation capabilities
5. Access to full audit logs
6. AI training data and model access

## Usage

bash run-guardian.sh
```

## Security Warning

**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT**: This GUARDIAN version should never be shared with anyone else. Even trusted administrators should only receive the ADMIN-READY version, which has the sensitive wallet components removed.

For collaborators who need administrative access, use the ADMIN-READY version located in the corresponding folder.

## Environment Separation

The three-tier platform design includes:

1. **GUARDIAN** (this version): Full owner access with wallet functionality
2. **ADMIN-READY**: Administrator access without wallet capabilities
3. **PUBLIC-DEPLOYMENT**: End-user facing interface

Each version is completely self-contained and can run independently.
