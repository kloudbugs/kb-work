// This file explains how to get the "Hear the Voice" audio clip
// Since we can't generate actual speech, we'll use a text-to-speech approach

/*
To create the "Hear the Voice" audio clip:

1. Use built-in text-to-speech functionality in your computer:
   - On Mac: Use the 'say' command with voice "Samantha" or any preferred voice
     (say -v Samantha -o hear-the-voice.aiff "Hear the Voice" && ffmpeg -i hear-the-voice.aiff hear-the-voice.mp3)
   
   - On Windows: Use PowerShell's System.Speech
     ($voice = New-Object -ComObject SAPI.SpVoice; $voice.Speak("Hear the Voice"))
     
   - Or use online text-to-speech services like Google Translate, Amazon Polly, etc.

2. Place the resulting MP3 file in the public/music directory and name it hear-the-voice.mp3

3. Make sure to use a solemn, respectful voice tone for this message

// For now, we'll copy the intro_welcome.mp3 file and rename it so we have a placeholder
const fs = require('fs');
const { exec } = require('child_process');

// Copy the intro_welcome.mp3 file as a placeholder
exec('cp public/music/intro_welcome.mp3 public/music/hear-the-voice.mp3', (error, stdout, stderr) => {

    console.error(`Error copying file: ${error.message}`);
    return;

  console.log('Voice clip placeholder created successfully');
