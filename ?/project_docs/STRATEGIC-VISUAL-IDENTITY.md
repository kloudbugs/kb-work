## Conclusion

The KloudBugZigMiner platform's visual identity, centered around a young Black girl, represents a deliberate strategic choice that serves multiple purposes simultaneously. This representation actively supports the platform's exclusive position by creating automatic self-selection based on values alignment while authentically connecting to its core social justice mission.

This approach ensures that those who proceed past initial visual contact already share fundamental values around racial justice and representation, creating a more cohesive community from the outset. Additionally, it honors Tera Ann Harris's legacy by visually centering those her memory aims to support and protect.

Rather than attempting to appeal to everyone, this visual strategy embraces the power of purposeful representation to attract the right participants while allowing others to self-select out of the process - supporting the platform's exclusive positioning through values-based visual filtering.
